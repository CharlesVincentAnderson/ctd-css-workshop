                              <p>To build a more just and inclusive world, the Pauli Murray Center for History and Social Justice engages a diversity of communities to lift up the life and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Pauli Murray, a 20th century human rights activist, lawyer, feminist, poet, and Episcopal priest with deep southern roots. As an African American, LGBTQ woman, Murray struggled to live fully in a world not ready for her inclusive vision of freedom.</p>
                              <p>The Pauli Murray Center, a National  Historic Landmark site in Durham, is on track to open in 2020. In our programming and organizational process, the Pauli Murray Center actively works toward fairness and justice across the divisions such as race, class, sexual and gender diversity and spiritual practice that often divide us. We embrace the transformative power of story and truth-telling, the arts, education, and spiritual practice as processes that heal and promote human rights.</p>
                              <p>Pauli Murray’s tenacity is inspiring; her vision prophetic; her social justice strategies instructional. Her story and strategies will help us address the pressing issues facing our world. We can all learn from her story.</p>
