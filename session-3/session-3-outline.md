     - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
     - [Typespiration](http://typespiration.com/) - Sample tool for help designing nice font colors + combinations
- Images
     - [How to add an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)
     - Basic markup: `<img class="fit-picture" src="/media/examples/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg" alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices" />`
     - [Responsive, retina-ready markup](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/): `<img src="https://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/coffee01-fortwo-1024x418.jpg" alt="coffee01-fortwo" class="wp-image-142" srcset="https://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/coffee01-fortwo-1024x418.jpg 1024w, https://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/coffee01-fortwo-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/coffee01-fortwo-768x313.jpg 768w, https://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/coffee01-fortwo-800x326.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">`

## Individual Activity
- Begin with the markup for `single-post.html` here in this folder ("No Name Lake" article).
- Add 2 custom fonts (Google Fonts) so that your article will have more personality but also remain legible
- Add any new markup that you need in order to create a "hero image" at the top of the article.
- This new section should have an image in the background with large, readable text on top of the image. [Here are several examples](http://www.tomatillodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/session-3-hero-images.jpg)
- Feel free to work in CodePen (copy/paste the markup over) or locally on your computer.
- There are multiple ways to create this. You'll likely want to check out the CSS property of `position`, and/or setting a CSS `background-image`.
