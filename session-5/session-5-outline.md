## Individual Activity: Update a Website for a Client
A client has asked you to customize their website. If you can complete the list, they are offering to pay you $500. Can you do it? :dollar:

Using the `index.html` and `css/style.css` files, write your own custom HTML/CSS to help your client achieve their goals. Here is the list of what your client is asking for:
1. Use a new custom Google Font for the "Atmosphere" logo/word in the upper left. Make sure the new font is legible but also large with some "personality".
2. Add color. Please pick a main color to use as an accent throughout the page. This new color or appropriate shades of it should be used on the following elements:
     - "Typography" button link in the main menu
     - Background on the "02" middle section
     - Background down on the "Fun Facts" section
3. Change the homepage hero background photo. Please make sure that the text overlay is still legible.
4. Add a [CSS gradient background](https://css-tricks.com/css3-gradients/) to the "Email Newsletter" section at the very bottom. The gradient should match/look good with your other color choices.
5. Change the photo at the top of the "About" page (about.html). Add a new photo that matches in size and appearance at the top of the "Typography" page (typography.html).
