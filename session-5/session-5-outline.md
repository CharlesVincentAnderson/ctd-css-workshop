## Individual Activity
- Using the `single-post.html` document, write custom CSS to create a different version of this page for mobile viewers. You can decide what breakpoint you will use in your custom CSS.
- Please create at least 5 differences throughout the page, and list them at the top in your HTML markup, in the <div> with the ID of `assignment-show-differences`
- See an example in my CodePen, here: https://codepen.io/tomatillodesign/pen/eaeVyy
- There is also starter code for you to copy/paste here in the Lesson 4 folder: `single-post.html` and `css/ctd-css-workshop-4.css`
